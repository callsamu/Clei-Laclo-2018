# Samuel Bruno's Machine Learning Projects

This repository stores data and codes used on my research paper "Cluster analysis of homicide rates in the Brazilian state of Goias from 2002 to 2014", which are publishet in the Proceedings of the 44th Latin American Computing Conference - Clei 2018. 

The data files are:
- DADOS_DATASUS: data from the Brazilian Ministry of health which contain the total number of homicides in the state of Goiás;
- DADOS_UNESCO: data from UNESCO which comprise the Human Development Index (HDI) and its three dimensions (Education, Longevity, and Income);
- DADOSIBGE: data from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics which contain demographic data from each municipality in Goiás;
- IDEB: data from INEP, Brazilian institute affiliated to the Brazilian Ministry of Education, which contain the values of the Index of Development of Basic Education (IDEB) for all the municipalities of Goiás.

The code file is:
- code.r: the R script used to build the unsupervised models described in the paper.
